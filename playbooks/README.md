# Playbooks: how to do it, step by step

A playbook is a guided path for one thing people want to achieve with PAROS: connect a tool, build a dashboard, organise knowledge, run meetings, think with several AIs. Each one comes from how PAROS is used every day, and the advisor walks you through it in **your** vault.

Ask with `/paros <question>`, for example `/paros how do I connect two Gmail accounts?` or `/paros how do I build a dashboard on my vault?`

**Status:** `ready` has a full playbook here; `planned` means the advisor answers from the principles, skills and kits that already exist, and a detailed playbook is on the way.

## Foundations
| Playbook | What you get | Status |
|---|---|---|
| [`start-from-zero`](start-from-zero.md) | No notes yet: Obsidian installed, a vault, your agent working in it, the areas of your life in one place, a first useful result, phone, cost and privacy explained; Obsidian first, no commands to type | **ready** |
| [`organise-your-knowledge`](organise-your-knowledge.md) | Areas instead of projects, frontmatter with content descriptions, an entry file your agents read | **ready** |
